#Glu Icecast

Icecast status page theme.


## Installation

1. Make a backup of your Icecast web directory. Usually located at:

	`/usr/share/icecast2/web`

2. Remove all contents from web directory and copy Glu Icecast theme files into it. I prefer to keep bare minimum of files on public side of Icecast.
3. Change the name of radio station:

	`<span class="radio-station">Localhost Radio.</span>`

4. Enjoy
